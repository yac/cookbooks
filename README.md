# yac's chef cookboos

I use these simple Chef cookboos when working on OpenStack.

## The least useless ones

 * `jru`
   * `yum install` my favourite tools
   * copy over various config
   * **put my public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`**
 * `zsh`
   * install `zsh` and set it as default shell
 * `grizzly-repo`
   * install right repo file based on node variable
